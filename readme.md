Twitch-brb is a fun little giggle that you can use on your stream to make your sheeps have something to do while you're AFK.

The idea is an "overlay" that connects to this "website" over a browser-source at OBS.
The users can then play a little quiz while you're gone.

Features:
 - Bad English
 - quiz
 - Bot TODO
 - score
 - winner displays on stream.
